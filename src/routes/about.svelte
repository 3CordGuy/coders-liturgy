		Software Development is not easy. If we believe that the power to do this alone is &quot;within
		us,&quot; we deceive ourselves. We need others. We need God&#39;s hand guiding us.

		it will be given him” <cite class="text-sm">(James 1:5)</cite>.

		Work is an order of subcreation. We image God when we work and create. Our motives and heart
		behind our work can make all the difference between good work and just another task. This
		website aims to provide some simple prayers as a means of heart redirecting, aligning our
		thoughts towards God's word and what is true at the end of hitting commit and submit on our
		code.

		Truthfully, I built this for myself. To assuage the fears, to subdue the grumbling, and to point
		my heart in a better direction. When it displays selfishness and pride, these words are
		reminders written for myself. They are joined with what I believe are true, God-breathed
		scripture.

		It&#39;s a bit of a scary thing to bare your heart—and to do it online. But I believe I&#39;m
		not alone in this. I felt compelled to make this public. Maybe it will help you, reader.
