		Software Development is not easy. If we believe that the power to do this alone is &quot;within
		us,&quot; we deceive ourselves. We need others. We need God&#39;s hand guiding us.

	<blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-12 text-lg">

		it will be given him‚Äù <cite class="text-sm">(James 1:5)</cite>.

		Much work is good at best, and morally neutral on average. Some is born of proper motives and
		yet other works get created with great pride or even laziness. Our motives and heart behind our
		work is where the difference is in most circumstances. This website aims to provide some simple
		prayers as a means of heart redirecting, aligning our thoughts towards God's word and what is
		true at the end of hitting commit and submit on our code.

		Truthfully, I built this for myself. To assuage the fears, to subdue the grumbling, and to point
		my heart in a better direction when its muscles of selfishness and pride get flexed, these words
		are reminders written for myself. They are joined with what I believe are true words from a
		God-breathed scripture.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&#39;s a bit of a scary thing to bear your heart. But I believe I&#39;m not alone in this. I
		felt compelled to make this public. Maybe it will help you, reader.
