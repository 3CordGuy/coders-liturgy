Our Father in Heaven,

Holy is your name. May your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.

You provide in this day, all that I need.

I confess, in this moment, I feel weak. I feel inadequate.
I admit I am tempted to compare myself to others.

As I remember that you are the ultimate measure, please let me rest in who you have made me to be and where you have me in this moment.
Grant that I may remember fully where you have brought me, and how you have provided, graciously.

Forgive me for the pride of thinking that I could be ever more impressive in the eyes of others.

Please set my heart and its desires on you.
Replace my insecurities with the goodness of your truth and love.

Into your hands I place these thoughts and anxieties that I am not enoughâ€”For you provide sufficiently.
You have me in this place, with these skills, with these tools.

Not my own strength, but yours will bring me through.

Let me rest in this.

Amen
