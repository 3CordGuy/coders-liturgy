God of all Creation,

At the dawn of this endeavor, I rejoice in Your mighty works.

And as I begin this new task, I humbly ask for wisdom and knowledge.

I know not what tomorrow will bring; help me prepare with foresight.<br/>
Help me craft a solid foundation on which this work will stand for the life of its service.<br/>
Likewise, let me not overcomplicate matters by my pride and worry.

Lord I ask for balance.

If I fret for the complexity, or the multitude of possibilities, let my mind find peace as Christ Jesus calmed the storms.<br/>
If I am overly proud, forgive me for a boastful heart and remind me from where these gifts have come.<br/>
If I stumble, may I reach out.<br/>
May I not trust solely in my own strength, but in you and those which you have graciously placed around me.

I rejoice in this blank slate of opportunity you have provided here.

Please bless the work of my hands.<br/>
Before I put fingers to these keys,
a sober realization is called to mindâ€”That the novelty will fade.<br/>
Like the flowers of the field, this work will one day wither.<br/>
In this humbling reflection, help me hold to the joy in these fleeting moments,
but ever more firmly to your word.<br/>
Your Word will stand forever.

Thank you for your promise of one day making all things new.
And as I begin this new work, I commit it all to you.

Amen.

Jesu Juva
