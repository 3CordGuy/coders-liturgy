God,

From the beginning you shown that I am a being made for relationship.

Fellowship with others and communion with you is at the core of my story and at the center of your heart for us.

It was not good for us to be alone.

So I thank you that I am accompanied in this endeavor.

As I embark to co-labor with another...

Grant that I may seek to serve,
before having my desires met.
That I may have a heart of understanding,
before an eagerness to be understood.
Let me have eyes to see and ears quick to listen.

Spirit, speak through me, words of encouragement.

When the answers are elusive or challenges arise,
help us to each offer each other a complementary strength in the gaps where lacking.

Be peace in our midst when there is temptation for frustration,
be it for the task or each other.

May our knowledge be shared in humility.
May we sharpen each other.
May the resulting code be all the better for our pairing.

Lord, go before us and bless us in unity.

Amen.
