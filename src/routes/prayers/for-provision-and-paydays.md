God of Provision,

Your kindness is evidenced by how you created and generously supply all things.<br/>
From the fields blanketed with wild blooms,<br/>
That put forth no work or striving for their beauty,<br/>
To the birds of the air, who do not store in barns and silos.<br/>
A world brimming with magnificent life, remarkable beauty and ordered systems—Your Word tells me that you care for it all.

And you care for me.

Today, I am praising you for this provision in my own life.

As I receive this compensation, I trace its origin back to the giver of all good things.

Forgive me for being so bold as to think that I alone have earned this repayment of my time and energies.<br/>
I would not be here without your grace and mercies poured out along my path.<br/>
For who has given to you anything that you might repay them?<br/>
I am owed nothing by you.

**Yet, you supply.**

And In this arrival of this bounty, I ask for wisdom.<br/>
Help me to rightly allocate these resources.<br/>
Give me a kingdom focus and a heart to love others.<br/>
Ready to give—because you gave all in Jesus.<br/>
Ready to love—because I was first loved by you.

Thank you for these gifts.

May I continue to trust you to provide.

...For from you<br/>
and through you<br/>
and to you are all things.

To you be glory forever.

Amen.
