# When Lacking Motivation

Lord I admit I don't have it right now.
The desire to move, to work this out.

My body would rather rest. My mind would sooner stray from this task.

As I reflect on this, I think of how my heart is prone to wander from you.
I confess I would sometimes rather not put in the effort,
but simply take the inheritance and run.

But you are gracious and merciful. You welcome me like a patient, loving Father.

By this same grace and mercy, I humbly ask you to remind me that:

My work is ultimately for you — not people.
My identity is in Jesus — not the work of my hands.
You make straight my path.

Lord be my motivation and turn my perspective on this task.

Be the wellspring of my joy.

May the overflow of my relationship with you spill out onto this good work.

And may I trust you in all of it.

Amen.
