God of all strength and comfort,

I am now reminded of my limits.

This new laboring outside of my comfort zone and expertise, does not catch you by surprise.

In these moments, though, I feel my frailty.

Whether by...

anxiety,<br/>
fear,<br/>
doubt,<br/>
self-pity,<br/>
believed lies,<br/>

...these enemies of peace seek to disrupt.

At the gates of this unknown,
I praise you that you have promised to be with me and have not abandoned me to these enemies of my heart and mind.
You are good to bridge the gaps and bring about glorious outcomes.

Holy Spirit, please fill my thoughts with truth.<br/>
Replace the lies that echo in my heart.

And in these moments where I feel<br/>
humbled before peers or superiors,<br/>
with no familiarity or history to fall back on,<br/>
may you remind me that I am not the sum of my experience and knowledge.

I am loved as I amâ€”by you and by others.

Not having answers,<br/>
not being an expert,<br/>
starting from zero,<br/>
using tools I am uncomfortable with... Is good for me.<br/>

Forgive me for demanding or expecting otherwise.

These rocky places remind and humble me:

That you love me to completion.<br/>
That you do not leave me where I am.

Grant that I may have peace in my weakness,<br/>
relying on your strength,<br/>
for your glory.

Amen.
