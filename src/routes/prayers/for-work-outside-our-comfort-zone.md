God of all strength and comfort,

I feel this laboring is outside of my comfort zone and expertise. Yet it does not catch you by surprise.

In these moments, I feel my frailty. My limits.

My thoughts may seem chaotic.<br/>
They bounce from
anxiety,<br/>
to fear,<br/>
to doubt,<br/>
to self-pity,<br/>
to lies,<br/>
to pride.<br/>
These thoughts disrupt peace and steal the joy from my work.

Lord Jesus, help me.<br/>
Don't leave me here.
I _know_ you are gracious to bridge gaps and provide strength in times of need.<br/>
Help me to _believe_ it.

Holy Spirit, please fill my thoughts with truth.<br/>
Replace the lies that echo in my heart.

And in these moments where I feel humbled before peers or superiors,<br/>
with no familiarity or history to fall back on,<br/>
may you remind me that I am not the sum of my experience and knowledge.

I am loved as I am—by you and by others.

Not having answers,<br/>
not being an expert,<br/>
starting from zero,<br/>
using tools I am uncomfortable with,<br/>
this stretching—will lead to resilience, and reliance on you.<br/>

Forgive me for demanding or expecting otherwise.
For you began a good work in me, and will love me unto its completion.

Grant that I may be at peace in my weakness,<br/>
by your love,<br/>
for your glory.

Amen.
